This program will allow the user to find the nth term of a fibonacci number series
Declare the variables curr,next,prev,n,i as integers
Ask the user to enter which term they want
Store the number as n
Initialize the terms: prev=0,curr=1,i=0;
For i=1 to n
assign  next =curr + prev
	prev =curr
	curr =next
( here next means next term
prev means previous term
curr means current term)

when this loop is done, 
Give the prev as output.
With this the user can get the nth term of fibonacci series.
